## What is data science 

```{r echo = FALSE, message=FALSE}

alzheimer_data <- read.csv('data/alzheimer_data.csv') %>% 
  select(id, diagnosis, age, educ, female, height, weight) %>% 
  mutate(diagnosis = as.factor(diagnosis), female = as.factor(female))

```

- Data-intensive studies have led to a new paradigm in scientific research. 

- Within this new paradigm, there are emerging challenges involving analysis of large-scale datasets. 

- To tackle these challenges, the field of __data science__ brings together _statistics, computer science_, and _mathematics_ to solve data intensive problems.

- At its core, data science relies on statistical methods to solve scientific problems. These methods have their foundation in mathematics and are implemented using computational techniques.

## Some general terminologies

- To study a population, we measure a set of characteristics, which we refer to as __variables__.

- The objective of many scientific studies is to
learn about the __variation__ of a specific characteristic
(e.g., BMI, disease status) in the population of interest. 

- In many studies, we are interested in possible __relationships__ among different variables.

## Some general terminologies

- We refer to the variables that are the main focus of our study as the
__response__ (or target) variables. 

- In contrast, we call variables that explain or predict the variation in the response variable as
__explanatory__ variables or __predictors__ depending on the role of these variables.

- Statistical analysis begins with a scientific problem usually presented
in the form of a __hypothesis testing__, __estimation__, or __prediction__
problem.

<!-- ## Study design -->

<!-- If possible, before we conduct our study, we need to design it in order to (Cox and Donnelly, 2011) -->
<!--   + avoid systematic error -->

<!--   + reduce non-systematic error -->

<!--   + ensure the scale of effort is appropriate; Goldilocks rule: not too limited, not too wasteful, just right! -->

## Common study designs

- Survey studies: Researchers collect information from individuals through some questions

- Observational studies: Researchers are passive examiners, trying to have the least impact on the data collection process.  

- Experiments: Researchers attempt to control the process as much as possible.


---

## Sampling design

- We cannot of course observe the whole population of interest or conduct experiments on them. 

- Instead, we select a __sample__ of representative members from the population.

- There are various sampling schemes

  <!-- - Simple random sampling -->
  <!-- - Stratified sampling -->
  <!-- - Cluster sampling -->
  <!-- - Multi-stage and temporal sampling -->



---

## Statistical inference

- We collect data on a sample from the population in order to learn about the whole population. 

- Note that in general the characteristics, relationships, and realities in the whole population always remain unknown. 

- Therefore, there is always some __uncertainty__ associated with our inference. 

- In Statistics, the mathematical tool to address uncertainty is __probability__. 


---

## Statistical inference

- The process of using the data to draw conclusions about the whole population, while acknowledging the extent of our uncertainty about our findings, is called __statistical inference__. 

- The knowledge we acquire from data through statistical inference allows us to make decisions with respect to the scientific problem that
motivated our study and our data analysis. 

- In this program, we will discuss some core statistical inference methods and use them to solve some scientific problems related to Alzheimer's disease.

- Before doing that, however, we need to understand the problem and carefully explore (and describe) the data; this will be the focus of Week 1.
